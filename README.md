Docker containers should be deployed using Ansible. It's done by creating an Ansible template file stored in a public GitHub repository. This template will then deploy a Docker container running an Apache service with a static web page. Furthermore, network communication must be configured to ensure the container is accessible from the host machine. Finally, a network diagram has been made to visualize the deployment, depicting the container operating on a specific subnet (172.16.8.10.0/30) and demonstrating how traffic flows between the host and the container.
